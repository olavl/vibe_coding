Product Requirements Document: BlockPlan – Living Room Edition
1. Functional Requirements
1.1 Room Layout
Users can draw the outline of a living room using a sketch-style tool on a 2D canvas.

The outline supports irregular shapes, but must form a closed polygon.

Users can assign dimensions (length/width) to edges or points via click or input.

The room plan is drawn on a snap-to-grid canvas (default: 0.5m increments).

1.2 Object Placement
A palette of prefabricated furniture objects is provided:

Couch, bench, TV, mirror, plant, lamp, piano, carpet

Each object has:

A default 3D model (blocky/abstract, not photorealistic)

A set of optional design variations (2–3 styles max)

A customizable color

Objects can be dragged, placed, rotated on the 2D canvas.

1.3 Simplified 3D Rendering
User selects a point inside the room and a view direction (N, S, E, W).

The app renders a static 3D scene from that viewpoint:

Extrudes the room polygon vertically

Places simplified 3D versions of the furniture at specified positions

Uses basic ambient lighting and fixed camera angle

1.4 UI & Controls
Sidebar includes:

Furniture palette

Color selector

Viewpoint selector for 3D render

Canvas allows:

Sketching room layout

Dragging and rotating furniture

Snapping to grid

Zoom/pan in 2D

1.5 Export
Users can export:

A screenshot of the 3D view

A JSON representation of the room layout and object placements

2. Non-Functional Requirements
Must load in under 3 seconds in a modern browser.

Should support ~15–20 objects without visible performance degradation.

Must support mouse interaction on desktop; mobile support optional.

3. Constraints & Exclusions
No multiple rooms or architectural wall editing.

No lighting configuration, materials, or textures beyond solid colors.

No 3D interactivity—rendered scenes are static images.

No saving to account or persistent cloud storage; export is client-side only.
