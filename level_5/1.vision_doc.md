Vision Document: Floorplan Designer with 3D Visualization
Project Name: BlockPlan
Purpose
To enable users to design custom architectural floorplans through an intuitive, browser-based interface and instantly visualize the result in 3D. The tool will focus on ease of use, real-time feedback, and architectural correctness without requiring technical drawing skills.

Goals
Let users place and arrange functional spaces (e.g., bedroom, kitchen, bathroom) via a drag-and-drop interface on a 2D grid.

Automatically generate a 3D extrusion of the 2D layout in real time.

Ensure visual clarity, geometric correctness, and intuitive interaction at all times.

Provide a minimal but high-fidelity experience suitable for design ideation, not professional drafting.

Value Proposition
Most existing floorplan tools are either too complex (CAD-level detail) or too constrained (pre-fab layouts). BlockPlan fills the gap by offering a fast, creative sandbox where anyone—from hobbyist to interior designer—can translate spatial ideas into clear, buildable 3D models.

Key Capabilities
2D layout interface with snapping, scaling, and drag-drop mechanics.

A room "palette" (kitchen, bedroom, hallway, etc.) with basic properties (width, depth, height).

Real-time 3D rendering synced to the 2D plan.

Export of design as image or JSON layout for reuse or sharing.

Non-Goals
This is not a BIM or CAD replacement—no electrical/water/heating systems, no blueprint precision.

No detailed furniture modeling or high-resolution material rendering.
