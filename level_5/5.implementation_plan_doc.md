Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Application Shell
Initialize Project:
Set up a new React project (e.g., using create-react-app or Vite).
Install required dependencies: react, react-dom, zustand, react-konva, three. Also, install a library for screenshotting if needed later (e.g., html2canvas, though renderer.domElement.toDataURL() might suffice per LLD 3.7/5.1).
Establish Directory Structure:
Create standard folders: src/components, src/store, src/utils, src/assets (for potential 3D models/icons).
Implement App Shell (<App /> - LLD 3.1):
Create the main App.tsx (or .js) component.
Define basic layout placeholders for: Toolbar, Object Palette (Sidebar), 2D Canvas area, 3D Canvas area (initially hidden or empty), Properties Panel (Sidebar).
Implement basic mode state management within <App /> or a dedicated UI state store (e.g., Sketch, Object, 3D View as per LLD 1.1).
Set Up State Management (Zustand - LLD 4.1, 4.2):
Create src/store/roomState.ts. Define the RoomState interface and implement the Zustand store with initial state (points: [], isClosed: false) and empty function placeholders (addPoint, closePolygon, reset).
Create src/store/furnitureState.ts. Define the FurnitureObject type (LLD 2.2) and FurnitureState interface. Implement the Zustand store with initial state (objects: {}, selectedId: null) and empty function placeholders (add, update, remove, setSelectedId).
Provide these stores to the application, likely via React Context if needed (LLD 3.1).
Phase 2: 2D Canvas - Room Sketching
Implement <Canvas2D /> Component (LLD 3.2):
Create src/components/Canvas2D.tsx.
Integrate react-konva: Use <Stage> and <Layer>. Set appropriate dimensions.
Implement Grid:
Within <Canvas2D />, draw the grid lines using Konva Line components based on the 0.5m spacing and 100px=1m scale (LLD 7).
Implement Snapping Utility:
Create src/utils/snapToGrid.ts (or place logic within <Canvas2D />). Implement the snapToGrid(pos: Point): Point function (LLD 3.2).
Implement Point Drawing Logic (handleDrawClick - LLD 3.2):
Add an event handler (onMouseDown or onClick) to the Konva <Stage>.
Inside the handler (when in "Sketch Mode"):
Get the click position (pos).
Snap the position using snapToGrid.
Store this snapped point in a temporary local state array (drawPoints within <Canvas2D />).
Implement Drawing Visual Feedback (LLD 6):
Render Konva Line segments connecting the points in the temporary drawPoints array.
Implement hover feedback: On onMouseMove over the stage, calculate the snapped hover position (hoverPoint) and render a preview line from the last drawPoint to hoverPoint.
Implement Polygon Finalization (finalizePolygon - LLD 3.2, 6):
In the handleDrawClick logic, check if the current clicked point is close to the first point in drawPoints (within a small threshold) and if there are enough points (e.g., >= 3).
If the closing condition is met:
Perform basic validation (e.g., ensure no self-intersections - can be simplified initially).
If valid, call the roomState.addPoint(p) action for each point in drawPoints and then roomState.closePolygon() to update the global state.
Clear the temporary drawPoints state.
Render Final Room Polygon:
In <Canvas2D />, subscribe to roomState.
If roomState.isClosed is true, render the polygon using a Konva Line component, passing roomState.points to the points prop and setting closed={true}.
Implement Mode Switching (Basic):
Add basic controls (e.g., buttons in a placeholder Toolbar) to switch the application mode state between "Sketch Mode" and "Object Mode". Ensure drawing logic only runs in "Sketch Mode".
Phase 3: Furniture Palette & Placement
Implement <ObjectPalette /> (LLD 3.3):
Create src/components/ObjectPalette.tsx.
List the furniture items specified in Requirements 1.2 (Couch, Bench, TV, etc.) with icons/previews.
Make each item draggable, embedding necessary metadata (e.g., type: 'couch', variant: 'default') in the drag data. Use standard HTML5 drag-and-drop API or a library compatible with Konva.
Implement Furniture Drop Handling (handleFurnitureDrop - LLD 3.2):
Add drop event listeners (onDrop, onDragOver) to the Konva <Stage> in <Canvas2D />.
In the onDrop handler (when in "Object Mode"):
Prevent default drop behavior.
Get the drop position (pos) relative to the stage.
Snap the position using snapToGrid.
Extract the furniture type and variant from the drag data.
Generate a unique ID (e.g., using uuid or a simple counter).
Create a FurnitureObject (LLD 2.2) with the ID, type, snapped position [x, y], default rotation (0), default color (e.g., '#cccccc'), and variant.
Call the furnitureState.add(newObject) action.
Phase 4: Furniture Rendering & Basic Manipulation (2D)
Render Furniture on Canvas:
In <Canvas2D />, subscribe to furnitureState.objects.
Iterate over Object.values(furnitureState.objects) and render a <FurnitureObject /> component for each one.
Implement <FurnitureObject /> Component (LLD 3.4):
Create src/components/FurnitureObject.tsx.
Use a Konva <Group> as the main container. Make the group draggable.
Pass object properties (id, position, rotation, color, type) as props.
Render a placeholder visual (e.g., Konva Rect or Text) inside the Group based on the object's type and dimensions (use placeholder dimensions initially, scaled according to LLD 7). Apply the object's color and rotation (convert degrees to radians for Konva) to the Group or shape.
Position the <Group> using its x and y props based on the object's position.
Implement Furniture Dragging:
Add onDragEnd handler to the Konva <Group> in <FurnitureObject />.
Inside the handler:
Get the new position (event.target.position()).
Snap the new position using snapToGrid.
Call furnitureState.update(id, { position: [snappedPos.x, snappedPos.y] }).
Implement Furniture Selection:
Add an onClick handler to the Konva <Group> in <FurnitureObject />.
Inside the handler, call furnitureState.setSelectedId(id) (pass the object's ID).
Visually indicate selection: In <FurnitureObject />, check if furnitureState.selectedId === id. If true, add a visual indicator (e.g., change stroke color, add a bounding box using Konva Rect).
Phase 5: Properties Panel & Object Customization
Implement <PropertiesPanel /> (LLD 3.5):
Create src/components/PropertiesPanel.tsx.
Subscribe to furnitureState.
Conditionally render controls only if furnitureState.selectedId is not null.
Retrieve the full details of the selected object: const selectedObject = furnitureState.objects[furnitureState.selectedId];
Add Customization Controls:
Display the selectedObject.type.
Add a dropdown for variant (populate with options from Req 1.2, e.g., 'classic', 'modern'). On change, call furnitureState.update(selectedId, { variant: newValue }).
Add a color picker input. On change, call furnitureState.update(selectedId, { color: newColorHex }).
Add a rotation control (e.g., input field or buttons for 90Â° steps - LLD 6). On change, call furnitureState.update(selectedId, { rotation: newRotationDegrees }). Ensure rotation updates the visual in <Canvas2D />.
Implement 2D Rotation Handle (Optional but good UX - LLD 6):
In <FurnitureObject />, if selected, render a small draggable handle (e.g., Konva Circle) offset from the object's center.
Implement drag logic for this handle to calculate the angle relative to the object center and call furnitureState.update with the new rotation.
Phase 6: 3D Static Rendering
Implement <Canvas3D /> Component (LLD 3.7):
Create src/components/Canvas3D.tsx.
Set up Three.js: Initialize WebGLRenderer, Scene, and PerspectiveCamera. Append the renderer.domElement to the component's container div.
Implement View Selector (<ViewSelector /> - LLD 3.6):
Create src/components/ViewSelector.tsx.
Provide options 'N', 'E', 'S', 'W' (e.g., dropdown or buttons).
Store the selected view direction in component state or a UI state store.
Implement Rendering Trigger:
Add a "Render 3D View" button (e.g., in the Toolbar).
When clicked, trigger a rendering function within <Canvas3D />, passing the currently selected view direction.
Implement Rendering Logic (Inside <Canvas3D />'s trigger function - LLD 3.7):
Clear the Three.js Scene.
Get current roomState.points and furnitureState.objects.
Room Extrusion:
Convert roomState.points (which are in pixels) to meters (divide by scale factor 100px/m from LLD 7). Create THREE.Vector2 array.
Create a THREE.Shape from the Vector2 array.
Create THREE.ExtrudeGeometry with depth set to 2.5 (meters, LLD 7).
Create a THREE.MeshStandardMaterial (default color).
Create a THREE.Mesh and add it to the scene. Calculate its bounding box.
Furniture Placement:
Iterate through furnitureState.objects.
For each object:
Load Model: Use placeholder THREE.BoxGeometry for now, sized appropriately based on typical furniture dimensions (referencing Req 1.2 types). Later Step: Replace with actual GLTFLoader logic if simple GLTF models are available in src/assets.
Create THREE.MeshStandardMaterial and set its color using object.color.
Create THREE.Mesh.
Positioning: Convert object.position (pixels) to meters. Set mesh position.set(x_meters, 0, z_meters) (assuming Y is up, map canvas Y to 3D Z or X depending on convention).
Rotation: Set mesh.rotation.y = THREE.MathUtils.degToRad(object.rotation).
(Handle variant later if models differ).
Add mesh to the scene.
Camera & Lighting (LLD 3.7, 5.2):
Implement src/utils/ViewpointMapper.ts with getCameraConfig(view, bbox) function (LLD 5.2). This function should return camera { position, target, fov } based on the view direction ('N'/'E'/'S'/'W') and the room's bounding box (bbox).
Call getCameraConfig to get camera settings. Update camera.position, camera.lookAt(target), and camera.fov.
Add basic lighting: THREE.AmbientLight and maybe a THREE.DirectionalLight.
Render: Call renderer.render(scene, camera). The result appears in the associated <canvas>.
Phase 7: Export Functionality
Implement Export Utilities (ExportUtils.ts - LLD 5.1):
Create src/utils/ExportUtils.ts.
Implement exportJSON(roomState, furnitureState): Takes the current state slices, formats them into a JSON string, creates a Blob, and triggers a browser download.
Implement exportScreenshot(canvasElement): Takes the Three.js renderer's canvas element (renderer.domElement), calls toDataURL('image/png'), and triggers a browser download.
Add Export Buttons:
Add "Export JSON" and "Export 3D View" buttons (e.g., in the Toolbar).
Wire "Export JSON" to call exportJSON with the current state.
Wire "Export 3D View" to ensure a render has occurred recently and then call exportScreenshot with the reference to the Three.js canvas.
Phase 8: Final Integration, Polish & Testing
Implement 2D Zoom/Pan (Req 1.4):
Enable zooming and panning on the <Canvas2D /> Konva Stage using Konva's built-in stage properties (draggable, onWheel for scaling).
Refine UI & Interactions:
Style the Toolbar, Palette, Properties Panel for usability.
Ensure mode switching feels smooth (e.g., disable irrelevant tools).
Add basic Undo/Redo for drawing/object actions (optional, bonus feature based on state changes).
Testing:
Manual Testing: Thoroughly test all functional requirements from File 2: Draw various shapes, place all furniture types, rotate, color, change variants, render from all 4 viewpoints, export JSON, export image.
Performance Check: Test with ~15-20 objects (Req 2). Ensure UI remains responsive and rendering is reasonably fast. Check initial load time (Req 2).
Cross-Browser Check (Optional): Test in target browsers if specified (defaults to modern desktop browser per Req 2).
Bug Fixing: Address all issues found during testing.
