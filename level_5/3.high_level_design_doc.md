High-Level Design Document: BlockPlan – Living Room Edition
1. System Overview
BlockPlan is a browser-based floorplanning tool for designing a single-room (living room) layout in 2D with simplified static 3D rendering. The system allows users to sketch room boundaries, place predefined furniture objects, and generate a 3D snapshot from a chosen viewpoint.

2. Architecture Overview
The system is structured as a client-only web application, composed of modular components:

3. Major Components
3.1 UI Layer
Toolbar: Tools for switching between draw/move modes, undo/redo.

Palette: Displays available furniture objects; supports drag-and-drop.

View Selector: Dropdown or compass-style UI to pick a camera angle for the 3D view.

Controls Panel: Object customization (color, rotation).

3.2 2D Layout Engine
Sketch Editor: Handles polygon drawing for custom room shapes.

Snap Logic: Aligns points and furniture to a virtual grid.

Furniture Manager: Stores position, type, rotation, and color of all objects.

3.3 3D Render Engine
Viewpoint Mapper: Translates selected viewpoint into a Three.js camera + lighting config.

Object Mapper: Converts 2D object state into 3D mesh references.

Renderer: Uses Three.js to generate a static scene and convert it to an image.

3.4 Data Management
Room Geometry State: Stores the room polygon and dimensions.

Object Layout State: Stores placed object metadata.

Exporter: Generates exportable JSON and static image output.

4. Data Flow Summary
User draws room → polygon points captured in Room Geometry State.

User drags furniture → updates Object Layout State.

User selects view direction → Renderer triggers snapshot generation via Viewpoint Mapper.

User exports → JSON and canvas snapshot are produced from current state.

5. Key Design Decisions
Single-viewpoint static 3D avoids complexity of live 3D interaction while keeping visual richness.

Client-only architecture reduces infrastructure complexity, improves responsiveness.

Prefab object models (standard shapes) ensure consistent rendering and simplified logic.

6. Third-Party Tools and Libraries
React – UI framework

react-konva – 2D canvas rendering (for room layout)

Three.js – 3D rendering engine

html2canvas or similar – For screenshot exports

zustand or Redux – For lightweight state management (optional)
