## Low-Level Design Document – BlockPlan: Living Room Edition (Finalized, Complete)

This low-level design (LLD) document details the internal structure, state, component logic, and interactions for the implementation of BlockPlan, a browser-based 2D/3D living room designer. It defines data structures, module responsibilities, function-level behaviors, and render/update flows. The system is implemented with React, Zustand, react-konva, and Three.js.

## 1. Application Overview

### App Modes
- **Sketch Mode** – user draws room outline
- **Object Mode** – user places, moves, rotates furniture
- **3D View Mode** – static render from chosen viewpoint

### Modules
- UI Shell (App)
- Room Sketching (Canvas2D)
- Furniture Management (Palette, Object, Properties)
- State Stores (roomState, furnitureState)
- Renderer (Canvas3D)

## 2. Data Models

### 2.1 Room Geometry
```ts
type Point = { x: number; y: number };
type Polygon = Point[];
```

### 2.2 Furniture Object
```ts
type FurnitureObject = {
  id: string;
  type: 'couch' | 'lamp' | 'tv' | 'mirror' | 'carpet' | 'bench' | 'piano';
  position: [number, number];
  rotation: number; // in degrees
  color: string; // HEX
  variant: string; // e.g., 'classic', 'modern'
};
```

## 3. Component Breakdown

### 3.1 `<App />`
- Entry point for the app
- Manages routing between Sketch/Object/3D modes
- Provides Zustand context
- Hosts layout shell: Toolbar, ObjectPalette, Canvas2D, Canvas3D, PropertiesPanel

### 3.2 `<Canvas2D />`
#### Responsibilities:
- Draw grid background (0.5m spacing)
- Render room polygon
- Render and manage furniture icons
- Handle drawing, dragging, rotating interactions

#### Key Functions:
- `handleDrawClick(pos: Point)`
- `snapToGrid(pos: Point): Point`
- `finalizePolygon()`
- `handleFurnitureDrop(type: string, pos: Point)`
- `handleRotation(id: string)`

#### State:
- `drawPoints: Point[]`
- `hoverPoint: Point | null`
- `selectedFurniture: string | null`

### 3.3 `<ObjectPalette />`
- Sidebar with draggable furniture icons
- Each object type has preview, name, drag metadata
- Emits drag/drop events with `{ type, variant }`

### 3.4 `<FurnitureObject />`
- Visual representation of an object in 2D canvas
- Bound to Konva `Group`
- Responds to drag and rotate handles

### 3.5 `<PropertiesPanel />`
- Context-aware editor for selected object
- Dropdown for variant, color picker, rotation control
- Updates state via `furnitureState.update(id, delta)`

### 3.6 `<ViewSelector />`
- Compass-like selector for 3D camera direction
- Options: 'N', 'E', 'S', 'W'

### 3.7 `<Canvas3D />`
#### Responsibilities:
- Extrude room polygon into 3D mesh
- Load and place prefab furniture models
- Position camera based on selected viewpoint
- Render to canvas, expose screenshot/export method

#### Flow:
1. Convert polygon to `Shape`
2. Use `ExtrudeBufferGeometry` (height = 2.5m)
3. Load furniture models via `GLTFLoader`
4. Place objects based on 2D position, set Y to floor level
5. Apply rotation, color, variant as applicable
6. Configure camera + lighting
7. Render and return image via `toDataURL()`

## 4. State Management

### 4.1 roomState
```ts
interface RoomState {
  points: Point[];
  isClosed: boolean;
  addPoint(p: Point): void;
  closePolygon(): void;
  reset(): void;
}
```

### 4.2 furnitureState
```ts
interface FurnitureState {
  objects: Record<string, FurnitureObject>;
  selectedId: string | null;
  add(obj: FurnitureObject): void;
  update(id: string, delta: Partial<FurnitureObject>): void;
  remove(id: string): void;
}
```

---

## 5. Utility Modules

### 5.1 ExportUtils.ts
- `exportJSON(room: RoomState, furniture: FurnitureObject[]): string`
- `exportScreenshot(canvasRef: HTMLCanvasElement): string`

### 5.2 ViewpointMapper.ts
```ts
function getCameraConfig(view: 'N' | 'E' | 'S' | 'W', bbox: Box3): {
  position: Vector3;
  target: Vector3;
  fov: number;
};
```

---

## 6. Interaction Logic

### Polygon Drawing
- Mouse click adds snapped point
- Hover shows preview line
- If distance from last point to first < threshold, polygon is closed
- Polygon validated (no intersection), then locked in state

### Furniture Management
- ObjectPalette item dragged to canvas emits `onObjectPlace`
- Placed item enters `furnitureState`
- Click selects it → opens PropertiesPanel
- Click rotate handle → updates rotation in 90° steps

### View & Export
- ViewSelector changes `viewDirection`
- Clicking "Render View" generates 3D scene in `<Canvas3D />`
- Screenshot or JSON export triggered from toolbar

## 7. Visual Standards
- Grid size: 0.5m
- Scale: 100px = 1m
- Room height: 2.5m
- Object sizing: use real-world scale in meters
